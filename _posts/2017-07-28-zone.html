<p>If you are about stalking &mdash; you can easily get to the Exclusion Zone in the Chernobyl region. This is not a Chernobyl itself, but the place is within the 30km alienation area and already a place to feel the Stuff. And… may be you meet some mutants there, who knows ;)</p>

<section class="tipp">
    <p>Please note that this trip can be quite tricky. Official law says: "During passing the Zone you should not leave your vehicle, otherwise you will violate the law". But you always have an option... you know, you wanna pee ;) Or you can drive through without stops which will any way be an experience. </p>

<p>Our destination is Polisske city - an abandoned town in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, part of Kyiv Oblast in Ukraine: </p>

{% include map.html 
    query="Poliske,+Kyivs'ka+oblast,+Ukraine"

%} 

<p>Of course, if you go there, you should be kind of prepared. First of all, you should be aware &mdash; that this is an exclusion zone, thus there is a remaining radioactive fallout contamination. However, if your goal is to be shiny at night &mdash; this is the place to be! Ok, joking &mdash; the risk is not high in this region. It is also known that there are some people living in the ghost city (round ten people). Because it’s a closed area there are a lot of wild animals and flocks of dogs. I would recommend to have something like sound-device to scare dogs (you can buy <a href="https://de.aliexpress.com/item/LED-Ultrasonic-Pet-Dog-Repeller-Anti-Barking-Stop-Bark-Training-Device-Trainer-Hot-Sale/32801515354.html?spm=a2g0x.search0104.3.2.VgDoma&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_5_10320_10152_10321_10151_10065_10344_10068_10342_10547_10343_10322_10340_10548_10341_10193_10194_10084_10083_10304_10615_10307_10302_10180_10059_10314_10184_10534_100031_10319_10604_10103_10186_10142,searchweb201603_36,ppcSwitch_7&algo_expid=2e39d20c-0784-462a-af29-8c4e9d1360e5-0&algo_pvid=2e39d20c-0784-462a-af29-8c4e9d1360e5&transAbTest=ae803_5&priceBeautifyAB=0" target="_blank">at aliexpress</a>) or some fireworks.</p>

<p> The trick to get the place without an official permission is that the 7km of the regional road (P02) goes through the Zone itself. </p>

<p>If you go there, you should go by some transport and better to be accompanied with ukrainian (or russian-) speaking person because you will have a short talk at the checkpoint: you probably will be asked for your documents and your destination. You just say that you go to the Ovruch city (if you start from Kiev) or vice versa. You can also say that you’re a special american agent if you want to have some fun :) Ok, better not, as our goal is an abandoned town. At this point you should hide all your cameras, as making photos are officially prohibited. However, when I was there I got a word permission to get some snaps from that guys at the checkpoint. So, things are not that scary and serious as you can first think.</p>

{% asset stalker.jpg alt="Exclusion zone" %}

<p>As soon as you pass the checkpoint you will get to the quiet ghost town... If you want to get more experience &mdash; you should get off the way and leave your car in a way that it’s hidden for other road users. </p>

<p>On this video you can check what would be your experience in the city itself:</p>
