<p>One of the most beautiful ancient constructions in Germany is the Bastei bridge. Bastei Bridge is 76,5 m high and made by human, it connects the rock formations. First wooden bridge construction was made in 1824 to link several rocks for the visitors. The wooden bridge was replaced in 1851 by the present Bastei Bridge made of sandstone. </p>

<p>First mentions of this place in the documentary refers to 1592. From that time on the region became popular among tourists and famous artists.</p>

<p>The place is very beautiful. The region is full of very specific naturally created mountains. These jagged rocks were formed by water erosion over one million years ago. There are only few places in the world with such natural type of mountains: Italian dolomites, Manument Valley (Utah, USA), <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/brimham-rocks" target="_blank">Brimham Rocks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan" target="_blank">Huangshan</a> mountains in China. The river Elbe makes the landscape even more amazing. </p>

<p>It is situated in the Saxonian region of Germany not far from Dresden. This area also known as “Saxon Switzerland” and is very popular among rock climbers and hikers. It is quite easy to get there both either by public transport or by car.</p>

<p>Here are some tips if you travel by public transport. You can take a train S-bahn (S1) from Dresden to the small town named Kurort Rathen. It departures every half hour, you can check the timetable <a href="https://www.bahn.de/p/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<section class="tipp">
    <p>The normal ticket price in one direction from Dresden to Kurort Rathen is 6.20 EUR, but if you are going to visit other places in the region or use other transport, the Daily ticket is the best option for you. It's called Tageskarte and costs 13.50 EUR</p>

<p>On the place it is quite easy to navigate because of the road signs. They will bring you to the bank of the river Elba, where you can take a ferry to get to another side. Both way ticket costs 2 EUR. You can find more information <a href="https://www.kurort-rathen.de/en/faehre.html" target="_blank">here</a>. This kind of getting to another side of the river is much more fun than just crossing the bridge ;) </p>

<p>Before you start to go up to the Bastei bridge you can have some rest and get food in one of fast food points or restaurants. The town itself is a nice place to give a 20 minutes walk.</p>

<p>The way top is not that hard, but if you’re not prepared it can make you sweat a bit. </p>

<p>On the top you can visit a museum Neurathen (1.50 EUR) &mdash; it is not much to see there, some artifacts from 17-18th Century. But it worth to visit for great views from it. There are metallic bridges between the rocks that may make you dizzy because of the height. The floor of the bridges are not solid in some places, so you can see the height under your feet. And be sure, you’ll get your dose of adrenalin. </p>

<section class="tipp">
    <p>Unfortunately, the main observation platform is closed forever for visitors because it got quite dangerous. But there are still a lot of places to see the surroundings.</p>

<p>If you cross the bridge itself, you will get to the <a href="https://www.berghotel-bastei.de/en/gastronomy.html" target="_blank">Panorama-restaurant and the Hotel</a>, where you can have some beer or ice cream with the great view. Middle price for a main course is around 15 EUR. </p>

<p>If you plan to spend a few days in the region, of course the best place to stay would be some nice house in the Kurort Rathen itself. But it's usually not cheap and you should count on the price around 70 EUR/night plus some small amount for Parking if you travel with car.</p>
