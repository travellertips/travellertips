<p>One of the most beautiful ancient constructions in Germany is the Bastei bridge. <br>

</p>

<p>The place is very beautiful. The region is full of very specific naturally created mountains. There are only few places in the world with such natural type of mountains (places). The river (name) makes the landscape more beautiful (найти синоним лучше). <br>

<p>It is situated in the Saxonian region of Germany not far from Dresden. This area also known as “Saxon Switzerland” and is very popular among скалолазы and hikers. It is quite easy to get there both either by public transport or by car.</p>

<p>Here are some tips if you travel by public transport. You can take a regional train (number) from Dresden to the small town named Kurort Rathen. On the place it is quite easy to orient because of the road markers (указатели). They will bring you to the bank of the river, where you should take a parom (паром?) to another side. Both way ticket costs (погуглить).</p>

<p>Before you start to go up to the bridge you can have some rest and have a lunch in one of fastfood points or restaurants. The town itself is a nice place to give a 20 minutes walk. <br>

<p>The way top is not that hard, but if you’re not prepared it can make you sweat a bit. </p>

<p>On the top you can visit a museum (2.50EUR ?) - it is not much to see there, some artifacts from 17-18th century. But it worth to visit for great views from it. There are metallic bridges between the rocks that may make you dizzy because of the height. The floor of the bridges are not solid in some places, so you can see the height under your feet.

    And be sure - you’ll get your dose of adrenalin. </p>
