<h2>About the salt mine</h2>

<p>Salina Turda &mdash; the salt-mine in Turda, is one of the most unusual and at the same time popular objects in Romania. The small town Turda is situated in 35 km from the largest city of the historical and cultural region of Transylvania Cluj-Napoca. Most probably you will start your journey to Turda from there.</p>

<p>Cluj has its own <a href="http://airportcluj.ro/" target="_blank">airport</a> and <a href="https://www.cfrcalatori.ro/" target="_blank">railway</a> (in order to view the timetable and buy tickets you need to go through the registration process). You can also get to Cluj with Flixbus from Budapest or Vienna. Pay attention to the fact that there is no railway in Turda. </p>

<section class="tipp">
    <p>Do not let the Romanian railroad website be misleading: when typing Turda it offers the nearest station Campia Turzii, but the distance from here to the mine is still 9 km.</p>
</section>

<p>To get from Cluj to Turda you can take a local bus (tickets from 7 leu, a rate of exchange is 1 EUR = 4,6 Romanian leu). Their schedule and prices can be found <a href="https://www.autogari.ro/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>The place is quite touristic. Since its opening to tourists in 1992, Salina Turda has been visited by about two million Romanian and foreign tourists.</p>

<p>Salt in Turda was extracted by a surface method in the time of the Roman Empire, and since then salt lakes have been formed on the surface. The salt mining began in the Middle Ages and ended in 1932. Its present look the mine has got in 2010 after the completion of works on welfare on financing of Europe Union (almost 6 million EUR). </p>

<p>The mine is divided into 2 parts: therapeutic and tourist. The mine has 2 entrances. If you travel on foot &mdash; I recommend the old entrance, if by car &mdash; I advise you to use the new entrance. There you will find a parking lot, a cafe and a souvenir shop. The price of a ticket to Salina Turda is 30 leu.

<p>The big red mark is the new entrance, the smaller with the photospot mark is the old one. Starting from the old entrance, at first you will find yourself in the gallery of Franz Josef &mdash; a long transport corridor for the export of salt.</p>

<p>On the way you will find many interesting museum exhibit. For example Kryvak &mdash; an authentic mechanism for salt extraction, put in motion by 4 horses.</p>

<p>The next room is the most interesting &mdash; in order to go down in it, you need to use a panoramic elevator or stairs (latter I don't recommend).</p>

</figure>

<p>Here you can play golf, table tennis, basketball, ride on a big dipper. There are swings and slides for children.</p>

<p>There is also a souvenir shop in this hall but remember that on the market at the new entrance souvenirs may be cheaper. Throughout all the territory of Salina Turda is a high-quality Wi-Fi. In the mine you can meet people who are not look like the usual tourists. These are pensioners and patients who are being treated here with healing air.</p>

<p>If you use one more elevator, you can go down to the underground lake, where a recreation area with space design was set up on the water.</p>
