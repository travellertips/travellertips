<p>Welcome to the travellertips website! My name is Greg. I am travel addicted astrophysicist-web developer (great vacation title, isn’t it?). At the very beginning I started to share photos from my travels on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/polinovskyi/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and getting often questions from my friends or even unknown people, how I got to the one or another concrete place. So this is how the idea of the travel blog came to me &mdash; this was the first step to create Travellertips.me. Later, some of my friends, also travellers, decided to share this idea and joined this project as Authors.</p>

<p>Our goal is to make our World more accessible for everyone who loves traveling. We are open to new ideas and new authors on our blog! We are not commercial organisation and we are builded on our enthusiasm. </p>

<p>Our love to discover the World’s beauties lead us to one idea that should make the trips and journeys more fun &mdash; at some places that we visit, we hide a treasure for You! To be exact: we hide the special outdoor metallic capsule with some interesting content inside ;) We put some amount of money (the more difficult to get the place and find the capsule, the more money we put there). As mentioned above &mdash; based on enthusiasm we can afford only amounts that at least make you smile (from 10 to 50 EUR) and give you, for example, a chance to have a good meal in a restaurant, or spend this money for some attractions around. Together with this nice present you will find also some easy instructions to make our World better :) </p>

<p style="color: red;">If you like the idea you can support us any time and donate. </p>

<p>To get all publications with hidden treasures you can visit our <a href="/treasures/">Treasures</a> page. There is a list of publications with capsules. Below the capsule image markers explained.</p>

<ul class="capsules-explained">
    <li><span class="capsule"></span> &mdash; that means that the capsule is not found yet and you should hurry up.</li>
    <li><span class="capsule-found"></span> &mdash; that means that the capsule was found</li>
</ul>
